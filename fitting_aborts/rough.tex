# Left truncating and right censoring to fit Abort RTs

The stimulus onset time is varying and has an exponential distribution. We want to find paramters of Proactive process 
- V_A, theta_A and t_A_delay to fit the aborts. There are two issues:
1. The abort RT distribution is bi-modal, there is a peak before 0.3 s. Since we don't have a modal for this bi-modal type distribution
we are truncating the reaction times that are less than 0.3
2. We also want to match the proportion of aborts(number of aborts/number of trials), not just the shape of the distribution. 
For this we are censoring the likelihood of reaction times that are after the stimulus onset time. That means, all the reaction times
after a certain  $t_stim$ have same probability.

To address the above 2 issues, we are fitting on RTs such that the reaction times are left truncated before a certain time
 and right censored after $t_stim$


## calculating likelihood when you have data

For a trial
- If RT is less than T_trunc, then the likelihood is 0

- if a RT is before t_stim, it is an abort, we calculate the likelihood using the PDF of hitting time of Proactive process(call $\rho_A$).
But since we are truncating RT less than T_trunc, we need to adjust PDF by scaling it up. 



% ----- figure of truncating increasing likelihood  ------ 


Area under the new truncated PDF has to be 1. So, we scale up the PDF by dividing with 1 - CDF(T_trunc)

likelihood of an abort accounted for truncation = PDF(t) / (1 - CDF(T_trunc))


- If RT is greater than t_stim, we assign the RT the probability of all samples that come after $t_stim$

Likelihood of a valid trial RT accounting for censorship = 1 - CDF(t_stim)



# But once you have the parameters obtained from VBMC, we need to test if the histogram of the RTs fits well with the theoretical PDF

There are 2 ways to calculate the theoretical PDF of aborts

1. you know the distribtuon of stimulus onset:

The stimulus onset time distribution (PDF_stim)= 1/ tau * exp( - ( t - t_0 ) / tau )
Prob that stim survives till time "t" is 1 - prob that stim occured before "t"
 =  1 - \int_{t_0}^{t} PDF_stim(t) dt = exp( - ( t - t_0 ) / tau )


 Prob of an abort at time t = Prob that stim survives till "t" & Prob that Proactive hits the bound
                             = exp(- (t - t_0) / tau ) * PDF_hitting_single_bound(t)


Note that you have account for truncation by dividing 1 - CDF of hitting abort at T_trunc

2. you don't know/want to assume the distribution of stimulus onset:

- Collect all the t_stim from the data
- for each t_stim, calculate the PDF of hitting abort at time "t"(NOT t_stim) multiplied by if stim survived till t_stim or not (t > t_stim or t < t_stim)
- Finally take average of all PDFs calculated for each t_stim
PDF of abort at time (t) = 1/ N \Sigma_{i=1}^{N} PDF_hitting_single_bound(t) * Stim survived till t or not 


# Note that once you have calculate the theoretical PDF, you can compare the shape of the histogram, 
but to check if proportions match

- normalize the histogram of aborts with total number of trials (multiply the histogram with num of aborts/ num of trials)
- normalize the theoretical PDF with fraction of aborts calculated theoretically. 

The fraction of aborts is calculated theoretically by:
- For each t_stim, calculate the non-censored probability(account for truncation) = 1 - CDF_of_hitting_single_bound(t_stim)
- Take average of all the non-censored probabilities calculated for each t_stim
- If done correctly, the above average should match the fraction of aborts in the data

Fraction of aborts = 1/N \Sigma_{i=1}^{N} 1 - CDF_of_hitting_single_bound(t_stim_i)   




\section{Left and right trunc VS. Left trunc and right censoring}
Instead of censoring RTs after $t_{stim}$, if we truncate RTs after $t_{stim}$, 
the credible intervals of the parameters(16th and 84th percentiles of VP samples) are wider because we are reducing the amount of 
information to the VBMC fit.
