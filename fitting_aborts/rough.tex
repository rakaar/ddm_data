# Post LED censoring on LED on aborts data(no truncation)

Terms:
 \rho_A(t | v,theta,aff) = Prob that single bound proactive(Proactive) process hits bound at time t(the process starts from zero)
                             given  drift `v`, bound `theta`, proactive delay `aff`
 \CDF_A(t | v,theta,aff) = CDF of Proactive process hits at bound at t(CDF of above)
 
 P(x,t | v,theta,aff ) = Prob that Decision variable of Proactive process is at x at time 't'


 
# Fitting Parameters Plan
We fit LED ON and LED OFF abort reaction times with 2 modifications:
a) In LED ON case, Abort times after LED Onset are censored at `t_LED`
b) Abort times after stimulus onset are censored at `t_stim`

# Likelihood

if LED ON:
    if RT < `t_led`
        Likelihood = \rho_A(t - aff | v,theta,aff) * P(x,t | v,theta,aff)
    elif RT > `t_led'
        Likelihood = 1 - \CDF_A(t_led - aff | v,theta,aff)

if LED OFF:
    if RT < `t_stim`
        Likelihood = \rho_A(t - aff | v,theta,aff) 
    elif RT > `t_stim'
        Likelihood = 1 - \CDF_A(t_stim - aff | v,theta,aff)


# Matching fractions
With the above likelihood, we find drift(which is considered pre-LED drift), theta and aff. To find post-LED drift,
we match the fraction of aborts between LED onset and stimulus onset in LED ON trials in the LED ON data. For different values of
new drift, we try to calculate the fraction of aborts and pick the one closest to data's fraction of aborts.

- Calculate number of aborts between LED onset and stimulus onset in LED ON trials and divide by total number of LED ON trials
- To calculate the fraction of aborts theoretically, 
 a) Sample t_LED and t_stim from the LED on trials
 b) For each sampled (t_LED, t_stim), calculate the fraction of aborts between t_LED and t_stim

 if t_led is not zero:
    fraction of aborts till t_LED = \rho_A(t_LED - aff | v,theta,aff)
    fraction of aborts till  t_stim = \int_{0}^{t_stim - aff}   \int_{-\inf}^{theta} P(x=x,t=t_LED-aff | v,theta,aff) \rho_A(t - led | V',theta - x,aff) dx dt
if t_led is zero:
    fraction of aborts till t_LED = 0
    fraction of aborts till  t_stim = CDF_A(t_stim - aff | V',theta,aff)
