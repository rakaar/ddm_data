# VBMC Fitting aborts after realizing right LED time
- `LED_off_on_data_fit_aborts_with_trunc_and_censor.ipynb` - LED off, data, Left trunc, right censor
- `vbmc_V_A_step_jump_fit_LED_ON_data.ipynb` - LED on, V_A step jump, data, Left trunc, right censor
- `compare_V_A_step_LED_on_vanila_LED_off_with_data.ipynb` - compare LED off and LED on aborts fit with Left trunc and right censor
- `vbmc_ONLY_step_jump_fit_LED_ON_data.ipynb` - fit only post LED drift, other pararms are same as that of LED off fit
- `compare_ONLY_V_A_step_LED_on_vanila_LED_off_with_data.ipynb` - Compared LED off and LED on post-LED drift fit
