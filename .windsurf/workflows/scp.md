Whenever i say scp these files to my machine, u need to give me scp commands to transfer machines from rlab@100.99.124.6 

I will mention the to address in the prompt, which is my machine. so scp command will be run on my machine.

Always provide a single combined scp command using brace expansion (e.g., `scp rlab@100.99.124.6:/path/{file1,file2,file3} /destination/`) to transfer all files at once.
